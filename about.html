      <h3 class="text-danger">About Me</h3>
      <p>My name is Tey Yun Nee, its obvious that my surname is "Tey", and 
        everyone else will just call me Yun Nee, or some weird nicknames that they made up with. 
        I am an-almost-nineteen-year-old girl that loves to challenge myself alot. 
        I can't really tell if I am more to an extrovert or an introvert because 
        I would love to have some social or interaction with a group of friends, but at the same time it would 
        be great to get myself some "Me-Time" as well. I enjoy both moments and situations as that's all parts of life. 
        I always think that there's no definite distinct to only stay with one kind of personality or lifestyle, 
        because it's not about choosing one of those, instead finding the balance between them would be the way it should really be.</p>

      <h3 class="text-danger">Where I Live</h3>
      <p>I live in Rawang, from the state of Selangor which is a 
        small city that located 30 minutes away from the heart of Kuala Lumpur. 
        In my opinion, it is a place that is far to travel to literally anywhere. 
        I've been living in Rawang as long as I can remember, eventhough 
        it is not as packed and bustling as Kuala Lumpur, but it gaves me 
        different kidn of childhood and memories in this warm-hearted surrounding.</p>
